# Editing Origins

Origins are your web servers that CDN360 accesses to fetch your content. A property origin can be edited only if the property has not been deployed to production. If you need to update a deployed property, either [undeploy](<../Properties/Undeploying a property.htm>) the property or [create](<../Properties/creating_a_property.htm>) a new property version.

1. In the left pane, click **Properties**.
2. <span style="font-weight: normal;">On the Properties page</span>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">, click the ID of the property whose origin you want to edit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">Click the </span>

**Actions**<span style="font-weight: normal;"> menu for the property whose origin you want to edit, and then select </span>
