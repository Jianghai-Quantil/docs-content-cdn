# Undeploying a Property

CDN360 allows you to undeploy properties that have been deployed to staging and production environments.

1. In the left pane, click **Properties**.
2. On the Properties page, click the **Actions** menu of the deployed property you want to undeploy, and then select **Undeploy from Staging** or **Undeploy from Production**.
3. When the confirmation message appears, click **Yes, undeploy!** When the Undeploying Configuration pop-up appears, either wait for the message that the configuration has been successfully undeployed, or click the **Go to Dashboard** button to perform other tasks while the undeployment continues in the background, and then click **Tasks** in the left pane to confirm that the property was undeployed successfully.
