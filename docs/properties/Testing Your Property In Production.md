# Testing Your Property In Production

After you create a CNAME and set your DNS server to point the CNAME to your property's hostname, you can browse your content under the hostname.

1. Modify your DNS server to point your hostname to a [CNAME you created](<../CNAMEs/Creating a CNAME.htm>) for the property.
2. After the DNS change has propagated, access your content through the hostname using your browser or scripts.
