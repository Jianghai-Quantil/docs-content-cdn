        <h1>CNAMEs </h1>
        <p>A Canonical Name Record (CNAME record for short) is a DNS record that is used to alias a domain name to a different domain name. Creating a CNAME record is required before CDN360 can begin serving as the reverse proxy and start routing client traffic through the CDN360.</p>
        <p>The following sections discuss how you can create, update and delete CNAMEs.</p>
