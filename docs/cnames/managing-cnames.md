# Managing CNAMEs 

A Canonical Name Record (or "CNAME") is a DNS record used to alias one domain name to a different domain name. The CNAME performs aliasing by pointing a domain or subdomain to the IP address of the destination hostname. In this way, if the IP address of the destination hostname changes, you will not need to change your DNS records because the CNAME will have the same IP address.

CNAMEs are managed from the CNAME page. Using this page, you define CNAMEs to which you can point your hostnames. To display this page, click **CNAMEs** in the left pane.

The following figure shows the key elements on the page, and the table following the figure describes them.
