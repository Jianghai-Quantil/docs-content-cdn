# Certificate Types

CDN360 supports the following certificates:

- **Certificate**: associates a property hostname with a single name.
- **Wildcard certificate**: a public key certificate that can be used with multiple sub-domains of a domain. For instance, a certificate for \*.example.com handles www.example.com, mail.example.com, and any subdomain of example.com. If you do not know what property hostnames you want to attach your certificate to, this type of certificate is useful.
