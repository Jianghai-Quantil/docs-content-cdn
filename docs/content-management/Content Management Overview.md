# Content Management Overview

Using the content management purge functionality you can override the cache time. If your website has a cache time of one (1) week but there is a new update to one of your pages and you want your website visitors to see the latest copy, you can use the purge option to flush the cache.

You should request purges when the content on your web server has changed and you want CDN360 to update its servers with your changes.
