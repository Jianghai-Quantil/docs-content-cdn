# About Properties

A "property" is the configuration of one or more hostnames (domains) that need to be deployed to the CDN360 proxy servers. Properties determine how you want the servers to obtain, manage, and distribute your content to the end users.

On the CDN360 platform, property configurations are versioned to support tracking the history of changes and allow rollback if needed.
