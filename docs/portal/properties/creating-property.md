Any property version will have to be "validated" before it can be deployed to staging or production. You can click the <strong>Save & Validate</strong> button to kick off the validation process. When the Confirmation pop-up appears, click <strong>OK</strong>. The validation process usually takes less than a minute. You can either wait for it to finish or close the progress dialog box to perform other tasks while validation continues in the background. You can click <strong>Tasks</strong> in the left pane to [check the validation results](validating-property.md). If there is any failure, please follow the error message to fix it.

5. If the property if validated successfully, you can [deploy](</docs/portal/properties/deploying-property.md>) it to the staging or production environment. Trial users will only have access to the staging environment by default. Please contact the support team to enable the access to the production environment.
