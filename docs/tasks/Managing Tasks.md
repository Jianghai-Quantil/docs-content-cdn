# Managing Tasks

Property versions must be validated before they can be deployed to staging or production. Each time you perform a validation, CDN360 sends the compiled property, along with its associated certificate(s), to a validation environment. In this environment, CDN360 performs tests to ensure that the server does not crash and runs artificial traffic to the hostnames associated with the property. Typically, the validation process takes less than 5 minutes.
