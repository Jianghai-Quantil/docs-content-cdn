# CNAMEs 

A Canonical Name Record (CNAME record for short) is a DNS record that is used to alias a domain name to a different domain name. Creating a CNAME record is required before CDN360 can begin serving as the reverse proxy and start routing client traffic through the CDN360.

The following sections discuss how you can create, update and delete CNAMEs.

- [Creating a CNAME](<Creating a CNAME.htm>)
- [Updating a CNAME](<Editing a CNAME.htm>)
- [Deleting a CNAME](<Deleting a CNAME.htm>)
