# Deploying Your Property

After you have created and validated a property version, you are ready to deploy it. We highly recommend you to always deploy to the staging environment to make sure it is configured properly and the behavior is as expected. Once you confirm that the property is ready to go live, you can deploy it to the production environment.

1. In the left pane, click **Properties**. 

2. On the Properties page, click the ID of the property you want to deploy. 

3. Scroll down to the **Deployment** section, select either **Staging** or **Production** from the drop-down list, and then click the **Deploy Configuration** button.

4. If the property is already deployed to the environment you select, the next form compares the deployed version with the one you want to deploy. If you are OK with the difference, click the **Deploy to ...** button on the top right corner, or **Back** to cancel the deployment.

5. When the Deployment Confirmation pop-up appears, click **OK**. The deployment process usually finishes in 5 minutes. You can either wait with the progress dialog box, or close it to perform other tasks while the deployment continues in the background. You can click **Tasks** in the left pane to check the status of the deployment.

6. Click [here](</docs/portal/properties/testing-property.md#testing-property-in-staging>) to test the property in the staging environment.

# Undeploying a Property

1. In the left pane, click **Properties**.

2. On the Properties page, click the **Actions** menu of the deployed property you want to undeploy, and then select **Undeploy from Staging** or **Undeploy from Production**.

3. When the confirmation message appears, click **Yes, Undeploy!**. When the Undeploying Configuration pop-up appears, you can either wait for the process to finish or click the **Go to Dashboard** button to perform other tasks while the undeployment continues in the background. You can click **Tasks** in the left pane to check the undeployment status at anytime.
