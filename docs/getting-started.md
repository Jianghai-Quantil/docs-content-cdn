# Quick Start

Using CDN360 to accelerate and distribute your content involves the following steps:

1. [Log in](<../Logging In/Logging In.htm>) to the portal.
2. [Create a property](<../Properties/managing_properties.htm>), which is the configuration to be deployed to the proxy server(s).
3. [Edit the property](<../Properties/Editing Properties.htm>) if necessary.
4. [Validate the property](<../Properties/Validating Properties.htm>).
5. Optional:Â [Deploy the property to staging servers](<../Properties/Deploying Your Property.htm>) and make sure the cache behaves as expected.
6. [Deploy the property to production servers](<../Properties/Deploying Your Property.htm>) and make sure the cache behaves as expected.
7. [Create a CNAME](<../CNAMEs/Managing CNAMEs.htm>) for the hostname.
8. Modify your DNS records to point your hostname(s) to the CNAME.

The following figure shows the steps for creating an acceleration service for a hostname.
