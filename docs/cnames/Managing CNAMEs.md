# Managing CNAMEs 

A Canonical Name Record (or "CNAME") is a DNS record used to alias one domain name to a different domain name. The CNAME performs aliasing by pointing a domain or subdomain to the IP address of the destination hostname. In this way, if the IP address of the destination hostname changes, you will not need to change your DNS records because the CNAME will have the same IP address.
