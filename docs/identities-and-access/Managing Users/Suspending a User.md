# Suspending a User

Administrators suspend users from the **Users** tab on the Identity & Access Management page. Suspending a user temporarily blocks the user's access to the portal. When a user is suspended, the user's username, roles, password, and other settings are not deleted. Users are not notified that they have been suspended. They simply cannot log in anymore.

If the user is logged in at the time of suspension, the user can continue using the portal, but cannot log in again after logging out. If a suspended user tries to log in, a message tells the user that the account is suspended and the user is directed to contact the site administrator.

The suspended user will not be able to log in to the portal until the user is [reactivated](<Reactivating a Suspended User.htm>).

1. At the top right of the portal, click your initials, and then select **Identity & Access Management**.
