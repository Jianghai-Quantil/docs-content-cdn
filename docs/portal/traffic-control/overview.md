# Traffic Control 

In order to use the CDN360 service, you need to direct the end users' traffic to our edge servers. This can be done by creating a CNAME record on your DNS server to point your service hostname to a CDN360 'edge hostname' you create on this page. You can maintain multiple edge hostnames in your account for different traffic management requirements. CDN360 supports sophisticated policies based on end users' geographic location and ISP as a smart DNS service. Most importantly, those policies give you full control of the trade-off between service performance and cost.

The following sections discuss how you can manage edge hostnames:

- [Deleting an edge hostname](</docs/portal/cnames/deleting-cname.md>)
