# Downloading a CSR

A certificate signing request (CSR) is a file that contains information a certificate authority (CA) needs to create and digitally sign a TLS certificate. If your website uses a CA certificate, you can generate a CSR through CDN360 to test your configuration.

**Note**:Â To download a CSR, the certificate must show **Owned** in the **Ownership** column.

1. In the left pane, click **Certificates**.
2. On the Certificates page, click the **Actions** drop-down list for a certificate, and then select **Download CSR**.
3. If prompted for a download location, browse to the location where you want to save the CSR, and then click **Save**.
