# Validating Properties

A property version must be validated before it can be deployed to staging and/or production environments. CDN360 sends the compiled property and associated certificate(s) to a validation environment and performs basic tests, such as making sure the server does not crash and running artificial traffic to the hostnames associated with the property. The validation process should take less than 5 minutes.

1. In the left pane, click **Tasks**.
2. To view validation tasks, keep the **Validation** tab displayed.

3. Click an ID or task name to display the details for that property.

**Note:** To filter tasks, type characters in the **Search** field at the top-left side and press the Enter key. Tasks that do not contain the typed characters are hidden. Filtering is not case-sensitive. To remove the filter, click the **Reset** button.
