# Navigating the CDN360 User Interface

When you first log in to the CDN360 portal, menus and submenus appear in the left pane and the dashboard appears in the workspace to the right.

The default menu lists the CDN360 activities you can perform.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the default page that appears when you log in to the CDN360 portal. It contains charts that show a snapshot of your account traffic over a recent period of time. For detailed information, hover your mouse over the data entry points. For example:

<p align=center><img src="/docs/resources/images/accessing-portal/Total Bandwidth.png" alt="total bandwidth" width="1000"></p>

From the dashboard, you can view:

- Traffic volume, traffic bandwidth, and traffic requests information for all properties.
- Status codes for all properties.
- Charts that summarize traffic bandwidth for all properties.
- Charts of total property traffic volume.

A legend below each chart shows the names of the data entry points in the chart. Clicking a data entry point in the legend removes that data entry point from the chart. Clicking it again redisplays the data entry point. Clicking **View FullÂ Report** below a chart displays that chart on the [Reports page](</docs/portal/reports.md>), where you can define report parameters, and then view the results on the selected chart.

## Reports

The [Reports page](</docs/portal/reports.md>) allows you to generate reports about:

- Traffic volume and bandwidth on your domain.
- Number of requests made to the files on your property.
- Percentage of each HTTP status code returned as a result of requests to your content.

## Edge Configurations

On CDN360, you configure the edge servers' behavior by defining [Properties](</docs/portal/edge-configurations/managing-properties.md>). The process of developing a property is very much like developing any other software. You can create and edit a property, validate, test, deploy and upgrade it all conveniently on this portal.

## Traffic Management

CDN360 also gives you full control of its Global Service Load Balancing (GSLB) system through the [Traffic Management page](</docs/portal/traffic-management/overview.md>). You do this by creating Edge Hostnames to be used in CNAME records to map your service hostnames to. The rules you specify for each Edge Hostname control where each end user's request is routed to.

## Certificates

The [Certificates page](</docs/portal/certificates/overview.md>) allows you to manage certificates to be used with the TLS protocol.

## Content Management

The [Content Management page](</docs/portal/content-management.md>) allows you to create purge requests and check the status of the previously submitted ones. A purge request is used to flush cached contents before they expire, in order to make the updated version to be available to the end users sooner.

## Tasks

On the [Tasks page](</docs/portal/tasks.md>) you can check the status of all previously sumitted validation and deployment requests. Some of those synchronous tasks can take a few minutes to finish.
