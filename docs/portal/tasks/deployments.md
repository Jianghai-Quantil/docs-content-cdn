# Check Deployment and Un-Deployment Results

The deployment of property and certificates is a quite challenging task. We need to send the configurations to the thousands of edge servers located all over the world and make sure the servers load them correctly. The un-deployment is going through exactly the same process. The finish time of each task can range between 2 to 5 minutes. If you closed the deployment progress dialog box when you started the task, you can always come to the task list to check the status.

1. In the left pane, click **Tasks**.
2. Confirm that the **Deployment** radio button is selected.

3. Click an ID or task name to display the details about the deployment task.

**Note:** You can use the **Search** box on top to filter the results. Filtering is  case-insensitive.
