# Deploying and Undeploying Certificates

After you create a certificate, you can [deploy](<Deploying Certificates.htm>) it to the staging environment for testing, and then to the CDN360 production environment if testing is successful.

**Important**: You must deploy the certificate for a property to use it.

If you decide not to use a deployed certificate, you can [undeploy](<Undeploying Certificates.htm>) it from the staging and production environments.
