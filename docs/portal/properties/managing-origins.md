# Managing Origins for Your Property

Origins are your web servers containing the content you want CDN360 to accelerate. CDN360 supports more than one origin for each property, and a plethora of setting regarding how to access your origins.

## Adding or Editing of Origins in a Property

1. In the left pane, click **Properties**, then click the ID of the property you want to edit. Select the property version to be edited, clone it if needed. You should see the section about origin as shown below:

2. If there is any existing origin as shown by the picture above, you can click the **Edit** or **Remove** links to edit or remove them. You click the **Add Origin to List** below to add a new origin. The following dialog box will show up:

The Edit Origin UI is basically the same.

(*default*)<li><strong>No Direct</strong> = always go to parent server first to fetch missing content.</ul>|
| Authentication        | Enables authentication for Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 servers. Choices are:<ul><li><strong>None</strong> = no authentication.
