# Deploying Certificates

After you create a certificate, you can deploy it to the staging environment where your original content is fetched and staged on servers set up for testing. If testing is successful, you can deploy the certificate to the CDN360 production environment.

**Important**: You must deploy the certificate for a property to use it.

**Note**: To deploy a certificate to staging or production environments, the certificate must show **Owned** in the **Ownership** column.

1. In the left pane, click **Certificates**.
2. On the Certificates page, click the name of the certificate you want to deploy.
3. Scroll down to the **Deployment** section, and then select **Staging** or **Production** from the **Deployment Destination** drop-down list.

1. Click the **Deploy Configuration** button. When the Deployment Confirmation pop-up appears, click **OK**. Wait for the message that the certificate has been successfully deployed, or click the **Go to Dashboard** button to perform other tasks while deployment continues in the background, and then click **Tasks** in the left pane to confirm that the certificate was deployed successfully.
