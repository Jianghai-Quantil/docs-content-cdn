        <h1>Suspending a User</h1>
        <p>Administrators suspend users from the <b>Users</b> tab on the Identity &amp; Access Management page. Suspending a user temporarily blocks the user's access to the portal. When a user is suspended, the user's username, roles, password, and other settings are not deleted. Users are not notified that they have been suspended. They simply cannot log in anymore. </p>
        <p>If the user is logged in at the time of suspension, the user can continue using the portal, but cannot log in again after logging out. If a suspended user tries to log in, a message tells the user that the account is suspended and the user is directed to contact the site administrator.</p>
        <p>The suspended user will not be able to log in to the portal until the user is <a href="Reactivating a Suspended User.htm">reactivated</a>.</p>
