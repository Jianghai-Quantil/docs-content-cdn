# Updating a Certificate

On CDN360, each certificate is versioned, and each version is not editable once saved. You can deploy each version independently to the staging and production environments. There can be only one version deployed in each environment at any time. Deploying a new version replaces the old one automatically. Therefore, if you need to update an expiring certificate in production, create a new version of that certificate and deploy to production to replace the old one. All properties using the old certificate in production pick up the new version automatically.

CDN360 sends an email notification when a certificate used in production is close to its expiration date. For convenience, CDN360 supports certificate [auto-renewal](</docs/portal/certificates/auto-renewal.md>) through [Let's Encrypt](<https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/>), so you never need to worry about the expiration of your certificates. If you prefer to renew your certificates manually, perform one of the following procedures.

## If you already have a new CA-signed certificate with private key and chain certificate
1. In the certificate details form, click **Create Version**.

## If you need a CSR to apply for the new certificate from a CA
If your company's security policy requires the new certificate to have a new private key that is different from the expiring one, follow steps 1 and 2 to create a self-signed version. Otherwise, you can skip to step 3.

1. Click **Create Version**.
2. Click the **Auto Generate Certificate** tab, complete the required fields (refer to [details here](</docs/portal/certificates/creating-certificates.md#auto-generating-a-self-signed-certificate>)), and click **Save Version**.

3. Click the <img src="/docs/resources/images/DownloadCSRButton.png" alt="Download CSR" width="120"> button on top of the Certificate Details page to get the CSR generated from the latest version.
4. Send the downloaded CSR to the CA to apply for a new certificate.
5. When you receive the new CA-signed certificate, return to the same Certificates Details page and click **Create Version**.
6. On the **Upload Certificate** tab, upload the new certificate and, optionally, the chain certificate. Click **Save Version**. You don't need to worry about the private key because it will be the same one as the last version.
7. Deploy the new certificate version to production.

**Note**:Â To update a certificate, you must be the owner of the certificate.
