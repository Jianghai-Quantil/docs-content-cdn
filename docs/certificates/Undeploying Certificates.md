1. In the left pane, click **Certificates**.
2. On the Certificates page, click the **Actions** drop-down list for the certificate you want to undeploy, and then select **Undeploy from Staging** or **Undeploy from Production**.
3. When the Undeployment Confirmation dialog box appears, click **OK**.
