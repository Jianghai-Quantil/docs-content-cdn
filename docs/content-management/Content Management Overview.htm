        <h1>Content Management Overview</h1>
        <p>Using the content management purge functionality you can override the cache time. If your website has a cache time of one (1) week but there is a new update to one of your pages and you want your website visitors to see the latest copy, you can use the purge option to flush the cache.</p>
        <p>You should request purges when the content on your web server has changed and you want CDN360 to update its servers with your changes.</p>
